# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Multiple Linear Regression project to predict medical insurance costs.

This project uses Multiple Linear Regression to predict the medical insurance charges for individuals based on a set of personal health and demographic features.

The dataset, called insurance.csv, contained information for many individuals. The key pieces of information (the "factors" or independent variables) used to predict the cost (dependent variable or 'charges')

A scatter plot was created to visually compare the actual charges versus the predicted charges for both the training and testing data. If the predicted points cluster tightly around a diagonal line, it confirms the model is predicting accurately.
